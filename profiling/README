The function that takes the longest is execute in um_execution as it contains 
the implementation of the um's machine cycle.
    
    Besides that, the routine that takes the longest is segment_load as it is 
    called very frequently and is calling on memory.
        
        There is very little that can be done to improve the speed of this
        function besides directly returning a value instead of initializing
        a temporary variable
