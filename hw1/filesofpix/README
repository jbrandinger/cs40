We received help from multiple TA's in office hours for some memory issues
and implementation advice.

We beleive everything has been correctly implemented. There was one odd line
when printing restored version of sail-corrupt.pgm, but since this was the
only image with such a line we assume it is just part of the image. Our
program is also limited to reading file names in the command line of a 
maximum of 1,0000 characters. However, readaline can handle unlimited bytes.

Total hours spent: 40 hours.
